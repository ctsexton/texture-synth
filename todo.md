## To Do

 - MFT LED feedback
 - Master knobs - interpolate time/manual^1, reverb input, filters, master vol/distortion
 - track rate - click to reverse, double click to return to 1
 - track volume - click to play^2
 - DIY ramp & switch in SynthDef

1. manual interpolation: push knob down to save and hold current position, press button for target and setup interpolation line, twist clockwise to move towards. release of knob and button should not need any mapping
2. click to play: may require adding start/stop to the memories. push down and twist CW to toggle on, click again to toggle off. push down/up for momentary behaviour.
